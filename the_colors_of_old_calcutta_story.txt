The Colors of Old Calcutta
Daisy once lived in a house that shimmered like a patchwork dream in the heart of old Calcutta. The walls were painted in mismatched shades of turquoise and mango, the railings trimmed with peeling gold leaf. Every morning, she sat by her veranda window, watching tram lines glint beneath the rising sun and listening to the muffled hum of tea vendors calling down the street.

Now, in a quieter city wrapped in grays and glass, she keeps a single framed photograph of that house — cracked at the corners, colors fading — but still bright enough to remind her who she was before the world changed names and faces around her.
